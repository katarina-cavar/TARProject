# Paper 09-01: [Less than you think: Prevalence and predictors of fake news dissemination on Facebook](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/1/eaau4586/tab-pdf)

**Note to self, after reading**
```
I don't like this article. 
Lots of political stuff.
Lots of discussion which groups share fake news. 
Almost no discussion on techniques used.
```


- fake news
	- concern about effects of misinformation in political campaigns
- 2016 presidential elections
- strong age effect
- conservatives shared more pro-Trump articles
