# Topic 09 | Bot Detection and Gender Profiling

## Topic Description

Bots that pose as humans on social media can have considerable influence on users. The nature of such influence can be commercial (e.g., giving artificial positive reviews to a product), political (e.g., undermining the reputation of a political rival through fake negative user comments), or ideological (e.g., shifting public opinion towards an idea such as Brexit). It is also very common for bots to be related to spreading fake news. Consequently, developing methodology for identifying bots is very important. In this project your primary task is to build a system that, given a set of tweets of a Twitter user, determines whether the user is a bot. A secondary task that you may also tackle using this data is to identify the gender of users that are not bots.

## Points of interest

- bot vs human
- male vs female vs bot
- extracting keywords or sentence syntax which most corresponds to each one? 
- next step: choose 2-3 singers, upload their lyrics and do the same? 
	- would it detect catch-phrases of some singers?
