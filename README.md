# Topic 09 | Bot Detection and Gender Profiling

## Topic Description

Bots that pose as humans on social media can have considerable influence on users. The nature of such influence can be commercial (e.g., giving artificial positive reviews to a product), political (e.g., undermining the reputation of a political rival through fake negative user comments), or ideological (e.g., shifting public opinion towards an idea such as Brexit). It is also very common for bots to be related to spreading fake news. Consequently, developing methodology for identifying bots is very important. In this project your primary task is to build a system that, given a set of tweets of a Twitter user, determines whether the user is a bot. A secondary task that you may also tackle using this data is to identify the gender of users that are not bots.

## Points of interest

- bot vs human
- male vs female vs bot
- extracting keywords or sentence syntax which most corresponds to each one? 
- next step: choose 2-3 singers, upload their lyrics and do the same? 
	- would it detect catch-phrases of some singers?

# Topic 11 | Detecting Emotions from Text in Context

## Topic Description

Automatically detecting emotions from text is a very difficult problem. The main reason for this are that computational models donâ€™t have access to the vast general knowledge and experience that humans take for granted, as well as the fact that text data lacks many non-verbal queues (such as facial expression) but also verbal cues that are lost in text (such as speech intonation). In this project your task is to tackle this problem. You must build a system that, given a user utterance (as text) and two additional utterances of context, can classify the emotion of the user utterance as Happy, Sad, Angry, or Others

	- happy, sad, angry, other

# Topic 18 | OffensEval 2020

## Topic Description

Offensive language is pervasive in social media. Individuals frequently take advantage of the perceived anonymity of computer-mediated communication, using this to engage in behavior that many of them would not consider in real life. Online communities, social media platforms, and technology companies have been investing heavily in ways to cope with offensive language to prevent abusive behavior in social media. One of the most effective strategies for tackling this problem is to use computational methods to identify offense, aggression, and hate speech in user-generated content (e.g. posts, comments, microblogs, etc.). There are three substasks to choose from 1) detecting offensive language, 2) categorizing offense types, and 3) identifying the target of the offense
